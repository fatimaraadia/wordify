🌍 Welcome to the Currency Converter That Speaks!
Hello there! 👋

I created this project during my very productive free time (a.k.a. when I was procrastinating on other tasks). It all started when I was struggling with converting numbers to words for different currencies. Sounds simple, right? Well, turns out, it’s not! I would often find myself scratching my head, thinking, "How do I say '2,345' in words for USD, INR, or BDT?" — and there was no easy tool that just did it for me! So, naturally, I decided to create one.

🛠️ How It Works
Select a currency – Choose from USD, BDT, INR, and more (coming soon!).

Enter the amount – Type the number you want to convert.

Hit Convert – And voilà! The number is now in words!

It’s that simple. No more typing out long numbers by hand and hoping you spelled them correctly! 😅
